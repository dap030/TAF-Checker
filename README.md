## Purpose
***
### Description

This is a static web page to perform automated Quality Assurance for Air Force TAF syntax and logic IAW AFMAN 15-124.  See https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3/publication/afman15-124/afman15-124.pdf for specific syntax and logic rules.

### Motivation

This is meant to serve as a stand-in for networks that don't allow the use of Microsoft macros, and therefore render the Excel-based TAF checker useless.

## Setup
***
### Requirements

This is a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript program with no external dependencies.  It should be able to run on any modern browser that allows javascript.

## Deploying

Simply clone this repository or download the zip, and place the html/javascript file(s) in the desired location.
